Visualize the results
=====================

HiPACE++ complies with the openPMD standard, therefore we recommend visualization tools utilizing
openPMD.

2D visualization
----------------

For 2D visualization, we recommend the
`openPMD-viewer <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer>`__. Please visit their website for an
installation guide and tutorials.

3D visualization
----------------

For 3D rendering, we recommend `VisualPIC <https://github.com/AngelFP/VisualPIC>`__.
The latest redesign of VisualPIC is required to visualize openPMD data. Please visit the website
for an installation guide.
