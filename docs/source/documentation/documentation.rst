Documentation
=============

Hipace has a full (all functions and classes and their members, albeit sometimes basic) Doxygen-readable documentation. You can compile it with

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   doxygen
   open doxyhtml/index.html

The last line would work on MacOS. On another platform, open the html file with your favorite browser.
