In order to kick-start HiPACE++, things were done in the simplest way possible, leaving obvious optimizations for later.
This file lists these easy optimizations, to avoid missing low-hanging fruits.

1. AMReX particle Redistribute
   All plasma particles have the same z positions, and once a domain has finished computing all of its slices, it sends all of its particles to the downstream rank, and receives all particles from the upstream one.
   If redistribution is taking time, we could use this assumption to make Redistribute faster.

2. Keep the main MultiFab on the host
   Currently, all MultiFabs are allocated in managed memory, and the data should live on the device for most of the simulation.
   To save device memory, the main multifab could be on the host, and slices would be copied at each iteration to the device.
   This would require:
   - Host-Device copies, if possible with something like prefetches to overlap these copies with computation.
   - Sort beam particles per slice, otherwise their deposition requires that the whole J array must be on the device.

3. Reduce the data in slices
   The individual slices Fields::m_slices, which should be on the device, has 4 slices (0->3, where 1 is the slice being computed), each of which has all components in the main multifab.
   This is overkill since, as Severin explained: Slice 0 only has the currents, slice 1 has everything, slice 2 has the currents and the b fields, slice 3 only has the b fields.

4. Avoid tmp copies for the Poisson solver
   When calling SolvePoissonEquation(rhs_mf, lhs_mf), lhs_mf is copied to a temporary buffer FFTPoissonSolver::m_tmpRealField.
   Most of the times, rhs_mf is a temporary array, so we could reduce the number of copies.
   For instance:
      currently: Jz -[TransverseDerivate]-> rhs_mf -[copy]-> FFTPoissonSolver::m_tmpRealField
      could be:  Jz -[TransverseDerivate]-> FFTPoissonSolver::m_tmpRealField

5. Removing unnecessary deposition of rho of the beam
   To calculate Psi, one needs to calculate rho - Jz. The contribution of the beam cancels out. At the moment, the beam deposits to both rho and Jz. It would require the beam to
   deposit its current to the slice and add its current to rho, AFTER Psi was calculated to skip this unnecessary and numerically not stable calculation.

6. have Psi only as a temporary array
   At the moment, Psi is a full field component. However, it is only needed for one slice during the field calculation, so a temporary array should suffice.
